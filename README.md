# Scotland Yard

This project was a university coursework piece for a module in object orientated programming.

If you are currently studying at the university which this is a piece of coursework for I would advise against not copying this.

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the Scotland Yard board game in Java. It was completed in a team of 3 students and it demonstrates the object orientated design patterns from lectures. It includes a full test suite and all the code is commented for maintainability. 

The purpose of the coursework was to assess both object-orientated programming skills and teamwork and was assessed in a viva. 

Most of the work completed is contained in this [file](https://github.com/henryedbris/OOP-public/blob/main/model/src/main/java/uk/ac/bris/cs/scotlandyard/model/MyGameStateFactory.java) as some of the other files were given as skeleton code.
